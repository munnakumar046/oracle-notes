Group by clause
===============
Group by clause is used to divide the rows into groups so that we can apply group functions.

A column which is used in select clause. Same column we need to use in group by clause.


Q) Write a query to perform sum of salary of each department?

	select sum(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno;


Q) Write a query to display average salary of each job?

	select avg(esal),job from emp group by job;


Q) Write a query to display maximum salary of each department?

	select max(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno;


Q) Write a query to display minimum salary of each job?

	select min(esal),job from emp group by job;


Q) Write a query to display number of employees working in each department?

	select count(*),deptno from emp group by deptno;


Having clause
=============
Having clause is used to filter the rows from group by clause.

First we need to declare group by clause then having clause.


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each department whose sum of salary is greater 
	then 35000?

	select sum(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having sum(esal)>35000;




Q) Write a query to display maximum salary of each job whose maximum salary greater then 25000?

	select max(esal),job from emp group by job having max(esal)>25000;


Order by clause
===============
Order by clause is used to arrange the rows in a table.

By default it will arrange in ascending order.

ex:
	select * from emp order by eid;

	select * from emp order by ename;

	select * from emp order by esal;	

	select * from emp order by esal desc;	


We can write a query using where clause, group by , having clause and order by clause.

	select max(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having max(esal)>25000;

	select max(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having max(esal)>25000 order by deptno;

	select max(esal),deptno from emp group by deptno having max(esal)>25000 order by deptno desc;
	
	select max(esal),deptno from emp where deptno<>30 group by deptno 
		having max(esal)>25000 order by deptno ;

TCL commands
===========
1) commit

2) rollback

3) savepoint 

1) commit
----------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	commit;
	select * from student; //2 records

2) rollback
-------------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.

ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	commit;
	insert into student values(103,'ramana','delhi');
	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','vizag');
	select * from student; //4 records
	rollback;
	select * from student; //2 records

3) savepoint 
-----------
It is used to make logical marking in database.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint.

syntax:

	savepoint <savepoint_name>;

ex:
---
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	
	savepoint sp1;	

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','delhi');
	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','vizag');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Alan','Texas');
	insert into student values(106,'Jose','Vegas');

	select * from student; // 6 records 

	rollback to sp2;


DDL commands
============
1) grant 

2) revoke 


Privileges
----------
	Permission given to a user is called privileges.

	Rights given to a user is called privileges.

	We have two types of privileges.

	1) System privilege  : Permission given by DBA to user.

	2) Object privilege :  Permission given by one user to another user.

Schema
------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.


grant command
-----------
It is used to grant the permission to the user.

syntax:
-----
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to <user_name>;


revoke command
------------
It is used to revoke the permission from the user.

syntax:
-------
	revoke <privilege1>,<privilege2> from <user_name>;


DBA>  create user haritha identified by haritha;
DBA>  create user rudra  identified by rudra;

Rudra>  conn rudra/rudra    //logon denied
 
Haritha> conn  haritha/haritha //logon denied


DBA> grant connect,resource to haritha,rudra;

Rudra>  conn rudra/rudra    //connected
 
Haritha> conn  haritha/haritha //connected


Rudra> 

create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10));

insert into employee values(201,'Kelvin',10000);

insert into employee values(202,'Jose',20000);

insert into employee values(203,'Mark',30000);

commit;

select * from employee;


Haritha> select * from rudra.employee; // table or view does not exist 


Rudra> grant select on employee to haritha;

Haritha> select * from rudra.employee;  

Haritha> delete from rudra.employee;  //insufficient privileges
      
rudra> grant delete on employee to haritha;

Haritha> delete from rudra.employee; //records delete
Haritha> commit;


Haritha> disc 

Rudra> revoke select,delete on employee from haritha;

Rudra> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from haritha,rudra;
